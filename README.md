## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Voter opens the application and logs in via `index.html` page.
2. They cast their vote using the `vote.html` page.
3. The vote is stored as a block in the blockchain via `blockchain.js`.
4. Admin logs in through `admin.html` and accesses the dashboard `admin_panel.html` to view the vote summary and results.
5. Final results are displayed on the results page `result.html`.
